# Circular-Times-Table-Generator

This program creates a representation of a given multiplication table by taking the highest number being calculated on the table and taking the modulo of the answer using that number. The resulting answer corresponds to a point on a circle (the number of points on the circle is equal to the number being use for the modulo, and are spaced equidistant from each other). In this example, the program is able to cycle through a series of different multiplication tables to show the transition of one shape to another, as well as the resulting cardiods found at specific intervals.

The other program, the Static example, allows you to view individual frames of the formation. This, however, requires you to change the necessary variables.
